# Usage
Take a picture of your test form preferably using your phone camera. Alternatively you could take a picture with your webcam; Of course, it is possible, since I originally intended to use only webcam pictures, although **results would be inconsistent**, so it is best to be used with high resolution phone cameras. The problem with webcam is that the resolution will be so garbage and its very hard to keep your paper still while you press capture on your webcam app that the program will have a hard time distinguishing between bubbles and question numbers, motion blur, etc. . 

In the settings file, type the year/date of the test (KA PT#3 or May 2018 U.S.) you are checking, the section of the test (reading/writing), and other options. When you run scanner.py, the program auto grades your test and gives you a score as well as all the questions you missed.

The 'answers.txt' file has all the reading/writing test answers for all CB practice tests #1-10 as well as a lot of QAS assesment answers i.e. May 2019 or May 2017. If you want to add any extras that I missed, use the **same** format I use in the file.

Currently this program only works with the old version of the SAT scantron. In recent years, a different scantron is used, but no functionality has been added for that because one is enough. Make sure the scantron you are using **MATCHES** what the sample picture uses.

From these two photos you can clearly tell the difference between Webcam and phone resolutions, as well as how the bubble outlines are much thinner on the phone picture despite, the size of the outlines in the pixel being a fixed value; in other words, the bubble outline on the webcam photo appears much thicker because the resolution is worse.
# Errors

The most common error would be the program over/undercounting the bubbles, it mostly never happens with phone camera, but can be pretty common on webcam photos.

However, if the program is bugging out, you probably didn't do one of these things: Held the sheet in front of the webcam so that the bubbles are clearly visible, held the sheet straight and not curved (although a slight curve would still work properly). A 720p webcam works fine also.

As long as your bubbles are filled in neatly and within the lines correctly, everything should work fine. The program tolerates messy bubbles AS LONG AS there are no bubbles connecting to each other horizontally through pencil marks.

This would **NOT** work, because the program would see choices A & B as **one** bubble instead of **two**

OpenCV, a computer vision library;imutils, a libary simplifying opencv actions into easy-to-use functions; and numpy is used.

pyimagesearch's OMR blog was a insanely helpful post that aided me and I used some code snippets in mine. I also noticed almost every python amateur bubble scanner on google/github uses this blog as some type of source...
