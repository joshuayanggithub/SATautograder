# Usage
Take a picture of your test form using your computer's webcam, which is started up in the program. Alternatively you could export a photo from your phone to the program files labelled as "test.png". Choose the year/date of the test (KA PT#3 or May 2018 U.S.), and then this program auto grades your test and gives you a score as well as all the questions you missed.

Currently this program only works with the old version of the SAT scantron. In recent years, a different scantron is used, but no functionality has been added for that because one is enough.

# Errors

The most common error would be the program over/undercounting the bubbles.

However, if the program is bugging out, you probably didn't do these things: Held the sheet in front of the webcam so that the bubbles are clearly visible, held the sheet straight and not curved (although a slight curve would still work properly). A 720p webcam works fine also.

As long as your bubbles are filled in neatly and within the lines correctly, everything should work fine. The program tolerates messy bubbles AS LONG AS there are no bubbles connecting to each other horizontally through pencil marks.
